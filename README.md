[Fairwinds Insights](https://fairwinds.com/insights) is a software for platform teams running Kubernetes to enable development.
A policy engine, Fairwinds Insights provides [workload configuration](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/first-steps/getting-value/#workload-configuration)
feedback loops, detects and prioritizes container security
vulnerabilities and provides
[Kubernetes cost allocation and rightsizing](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/first-steps/getting-value/#cost-efficiency).

Fairwinds Insights runs across the entire development lifecycle, from CI to Admission to Production. It enables platform teams
to find and prevent configuration problems as applications move from development to production. 

It provides out-of-the-box [integrations into CI/CD workflows](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/infrastructure-as-code-scanning),
an [Admission Controller](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/admission-controller)
for enforcing custom policies (using Polaris or Open Policy Agent)
at pre-deployment, and automation for running 
[Kubernetes auditing tools](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/in-cluster-scanning). 

Findings and recommendations are stored in a single location, enabling operators to gain visibility and control
over multiple Kubernetes clusters, track and prioritize issues, and monitor the security and cost of Kubernetes workloads.
