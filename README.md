[Fairwinds Insights](https://fairwinds.com/insights) is a policy-driven Configuration Validation platform
that integrates an extensible set of trusted open source auditing tools.
Fairwinds Insights runs across the entire development lifecycle, from CI to Admission to Production.

The platform enables DevOps teams to find and prevent configuration problems as applications move
from development to production. It provides out-of-the-box
[integrations into CI/CD workflows](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/installation/ci/about),
an [admission controller](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/installation/admission/about)
for enforcing custom policies (using Polaris or Open Policy Agent) at pre-deployment,
and automation for running
[Kubernetes auditing tools](https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/installation/agent/about).
Findings and recommendations are stored in a single location, enabling operators to gain visibility
and control over multiple Kubernetes clusters, track and prioritize issues,
and monitor the security and cost of Kubernetes workloads.
