# OPA
Fairwinds Insights supports the use of custom OPA policies to create Action Items.

## Enable the OPA agent
To enable OPA, make sure you pass `--set opa.enabled=true` when
[installing the insights-agent](/run/agent/installation)

See the [OPA Policy documentation](/configure/policy/policy) for more info on how
to write OPA checks and upload them to Insights.
