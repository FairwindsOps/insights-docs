# Nova
Nova is a project from Fairwinds for checking your
installed Helm charts against the latest versions available.
If there's a new release available, Nova will create an
Action Item for the upgrade.

## Remediation
All Action Items generated by Nova can be remediated by installing the latest
available version.
