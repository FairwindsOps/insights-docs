## Delete a Cluster or an Organization
If you'd like to remove a particular cluster from the UI, you can delete it
on the organization's settings page. You'll need to be an owner of your organization to do this.

You can also delete the organization from the same page.
> Note: deleting an organization will delete it for **all users**.
