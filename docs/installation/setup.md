# Setup

Fairwinds Insights can help you discover potential Security, Efficiency, and Reliability
issues with your Kubernetes configuration at each point in the development process.

There are three ways to connect with Fairwinds Insights:
* The [Continuous Integration](/ci/continuous-integration/) feature can report on issues during pull requests by scanning your infrastructure-as-code
* The [Admission Controller](/admission/admission-controller/) blocks resources with severe issues from entering your cluster
* The [In-Cluster Agent](/agent/about/) reports on issues with resources that have been deployed to your clusters
