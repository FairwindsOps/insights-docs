# Getting Started

### Create a New Organization
Once you've signed up and confirmed your email address, you'll be prompted to
create a new organization:

<div class="mini-img">
  <img :src="$withBase('/img/new-org.png')" alt="new organization">
</div>

Choose a unique name for your organization. You'll be able to add clusters to this
organization, as well as any coworkers you'd like to collaborate with.
