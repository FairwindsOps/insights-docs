in order to see aggregate costs, as well as potential cost savings.</p> <h3 id="cleaning-out-old-action-items"><a href="#cleaning-out-old-action-items" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cleaning Out Old Action Items</h3> <p>We've started removing action items for workloads that no longer exist. This is especially
helpful for organizations that create ephemeral feature deployments in their staging clusters.</p> <h3 id="new-registration-page"><a href="#new-registration-page" class="header-anchor">#</a> New Registration Page</h3> <p>Check out insights.fairwinds.com/auth/register to see our new registration flow</p> <h2 id="_1-8-0"><a href="#_1-8-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.8.0</h2> <h3 id="better-pod-counts"><a href="#better-pod-counts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Better Pod Counts</h3> <p>We've started tracking pod counts for each workload over the course of a month. By averaging
the pod count over a longer period of time, we can give a more accurate view into how much
a given workload really costs.</p> <p>We've also made some adjustments to how we calculate pod counts for Jobs and CronJobs, which
are typically short-lived.</p> <h3 id="polaris-1-0"><a href="#polaris-1-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> Polaris 1.0</h3> <p>We now support <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/fairwinds-polaris-1.0-best-practices-for-kubernetes-workloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polaris 1.0<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
in Insights. That comes with new checks, as well as the ability to create your own custom checks!</p> <h3 id="feedback-form"><a href="#feedback-form" class="header-anchor">#</a> Feedback Form</h3> <p>If you have feedback on your experience with Insights so far, you can click the feedback
tab on the right side of the screen. We'd love to hear from you!</p> <h2 id="_1-7-0"><a href="#_1-7-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.7.0</h2> <h3 id="action-items-performance"><a href="#action-items-performance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Action Items Performance</h3> <p>Performance on the Action Items table has been strongly improved by pushing more
of the querying logic into the backend. This means the UI will have a smaller
memory footprint, and will do less heavy-lifting of filtering and sorting data.</p> <h3 id="report-failure-warnings"><a href="#report-failure-warnings" class="header-anchor">#</a> Report Failure Warnings</h3> <p>It can be difficult to spot and debug failed reports. Now the Cluster Overview page
will show an item under Cluster Activity if a report fails, along with a link
to the logs.</p> <h3 id="longer-trial-duration"><a href="#longer-trial-duration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Longer Trial Duration</h3> <p>Free trials are now extended to 30 days.</p> <h2 id="_1-6-0"><a href="#_1-6-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.6.0</h2> <h3 id="bring-your-own-cloud-pricing"><a href="#bring-your-own-cloud-pricing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bring Your Own Cloud Pricing</h3> <p>Estimating workload cost in Kubernetes is a hard problem. Many factors go into estimating the cost, such as assumptions about memory/CPU intensive applications, as well as current resource requests and limits. However, another critical input is the current per-instance price you pay for your compute resources.</p> <p>Fairwinds Insights now lets you select the instance type you currently use to run worker nodes in Kubernetes, and configure the per-hour price, number of vCPUs, as well as GB of memory. You can also override the default prices used by cloud providers with your own price. This is useful if you have any special Committed Use Discounts, or run workloads in an on-premise data center.</p> <h3 id="weekly-email-digest"><a href="#weekly-email-digest" class="header-anchor">#</a> Weekly Email Digest</h3> <p>Users can now receive a weekly email digest for new Action Items found by Fairwinds Insights. These email alerts will not include specific information about findings; for that, users will need to login to Fairwinds Insights. User can subscribe and unsubscribe from email notifications by clicking their username in the upper-right corner of the screen, or 'Unsubscribe' from the email itself.</p> <h2 id="_1-5-0"><a href="#_1-5-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.5.0</h2> <h3 id="single-page-app-enhancements"><a href="#single-page-app-enhancements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Single Page App enhancements</h3> <p>A variety of “behind the scenes” improvements have been made to the Single Page Application architecture of the interface. This should enable a more consistent experience as you navigate through the application.</p> <h3 id="redesigned-workloads-page"><a href="#redesigned-workloads-page" class="header-anchor">#</a> Redesigned Workloads Page</h3> <p>The Workloads page has been completely redesigned to make it easier for users to find deployments, filter on namespaces, and understand the estimated cost of specific workloads. More improvements are on their way to this page! Let us know what you think!</p> <h2 id="_1-4-0"><a href="#_1-4-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.4.0</h2> <h3 id="new-tool-fairwinds-pluto"><a href="#new-tool-fairwinds-pluto" class="header-anchor">#</a> New Tool: Fairwinds Pluto</h3> <p>As Kubernetes matures, the project may decide to deprecate some apiVersions. The recent Kubernetes 1.16 release deprecated several, making it difficult to find all the places where you might have used a deprecated version. Pluto enables you to quickly uncover these locations, and results are now integrated with Fairwinds Insights as Action Items.</p> <h3 id="helm-2-support"><a href="#helm-2-support" class="header-anchor">#</a> Helm 2 support</h3> <p>The Add-ons page is powered by Fairwinds Release Watcher. This software now supports monitoring of Helm 2 charts so you can keep track of what version you’re using, and if there are newer versions available.</p> <h3 id="ux-improvements-for-add-ons-and-rbac-pages"><a href="#ux-improvements-for-add-ons-and-rbac-pages" class="header-anchor">#</a> UX improvements for Add-ons and RBAC pages</h3> <p>A UX “face lift” has been implemented on the Add-ons and RBAC pages, bringing a more consistent feel to the interface.</p> <h3 id="slack-notification-improvements"><a href="#slack-notification-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slack notification improvements</h3> <p>Many users have adopted our Slack integration feature to stay on top of deployment and configuration issues. The Slack notifications now feature a cleaner message format, making it easier to learn about new issues at a glance.</p> <h2 id="_1-3-0"><a href="#_1-3-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.3.0</h2> <h3 id="recategorized-action-items"><a href="#recategorized-action-items" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recategorized Action Items</h3> <p>All findings are now normalized to one of three categories: Security, Efficiency, and Reliability. Categories can also have findings from multiple report types and sources. For example, Fairwinds Polaris will report findings for all three categories, while Kube-bench will only report findings for Security.</p> <h3 id="new-dashboard-findings-by-report-type"><a href="#new-dashboard-findings-by-report-type" class="header-anchor">#</a> New Dashboard: Findings by Report Type</h3> <p>The Cluster Overview page now includes a summary of findings by Report Type, listing the top issues and the number of workloads that are affected by those issues. For example, a user who is concerned about memory and CPU configurations may look at the Fairwinds Goldilocks report to understand how many workloads are affected with excessively high or low resource limits.</p> <h2 id="_1-2-0"><a href="#_1-2-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.2.0</h2> <h3 id="cluster-overview-enhancements"><a href="#cluster-overview-enhancements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cluster Overview Enhancements</h3> <p>Fairwinds Insights is a comprehensive configuration validation platform that enables engineering and DevOps teams to run applications on Kubernetes securely, efficiently, and reliably. The software reports findings and recommendations for containers, deployments, and cluster infrastructure. Ultimately, making sense of this data and helping users answer “now what” is a key problem that Fairwinds Insights is uniquely positioned to solve.</p> <p>We have completely redesigned the Cluster Overview page to summarize data in your cluster and namespaces by severity and category. Users can click into these specific views to get “shortcut” access to relevant findings.</p> <h3 id="datadog-integration-beta"><a href="#datadog-integration-beta" class="header-anchor">#</a> DataDog Integration (Beta)</h3> <p>We are excited to announce the Beta release of our integration with DataDog. Many Fairwinds Insights customers use DataDog to monitor overall infrastructure performance and respond to problems. Integrating proactive recommendations around security, efficiency, and reliability is a natural extension of this experience. With this integration, SREs and DevOps engineers can leverage Fairwinds Insights data from within DataDog.</p> <p>The feature can be found under the Organization Settings section and requires you to have a DataDog API key. Give it a try and tell us what you think!</p> <h3 id="accessibility-improvements"><a href="#accessibility-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Accessibility Improvements</h3> <p>Accessibility has been improved throughout the Fairwinds Insights platform to make the system more operable and understandable for all users. Specific changes include:</p> <ul><li>Icon buttons, such as pagination controls on the Action Items page, now have labels</li> <li>Non-icon buttons, such as the filters on the Action items page, now have labels</li> <li>Form fields have been paired with labels, such as those found on the login and registration forms</li> <li>Logical groupings now have title attributes, such as the row of filters on the Action Items page</li></ul> <h3 id="ease-of-use-improvements-for-cis-benchmark-kube-bench-findings"><a href="#ease-of-use-improvements-for-cis-benchmark-kube-bench-findings" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ease of use Improvements for CIS Benchmark (Kube-bench) Findings</h3> <p>The CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes is a popular baseline for assessing the security posture of a cluster.

This saves time for DevOps engineers who need to find a secure version to upgrade to.</p> <h3 id="slack-notification-improvements-2"><a href="#slack-notification-improvements-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slack Notification Improvements</h3> <p>We’ve continued to enhance our Slack integration based on customer feedback. Admins can now select which channel Slack notifications are sent to. In addition, Admins can select whether to receive notifications for new findings in real-time, or as a “Daily Digest” summarizing new findings from the past day.</p> <h3 id="limit-cluster-comparison-to-a-specific-namespace"><a href="#limit-cluster-comparison-to-a-specific-namespace" class="header-anchor">#</a> Limit cluster comparison to a specific namespace</h3> <p>In the previous release, we released a cluster comparison feature that enables DevOps engineers and SREs to visually review configuration differences between two different clusters. For a cluster with dozens of workloads or namespaces, this can be a lot of information. Users now have the option to limit the comparison to specific namespaces, making results easier to review and analyze.</p> <h3 id="cis-benchmark-scanning"><a href="#cis-benchmark-scanning" class="header-anchor">#</a> CIS Benchmark Scanning</h3> <p>The CIS Kubernetes benchmark is a popular standard and baseline for assessing the security of your cluster. The test includes manual and automated tests; for the current implementation, Fairwinds runs the automated tests from the kube-bench open source project and reports back items that currently fail the test. CIS Benchmark Scanning is just the start of some larger Policy Management use cases we’re hearing from clients, so expect additional innovation in this area.</p> <h2 id="_0-7-0"><a href="#_0-7-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 0.7.0</h2> <h3 id="admin-users-can-limit-cluster-access-for-users"><a href="#admin-users-can-limit-cluster-access-for-users" class="header-anchor">#</a> Admin users can limit cluster access for users</h3> <p>Admins who add a user to an existing Organization can select whether they see all clusters, or specific clusters only. In the future, Admins will also be able to manage namespace access via UI controls.</p> <h3 id="get-slack-notifications-for-new-action-items"><a href="#get-slack-notifications-for-new-action-items" class="header-anchor">#</a> Get Slack notifications for new Action Items</h3> <p>Slack is a big part of our user’s day-to-day workflow. We’ve implemented foundational support for Slack notifications for new Action Items generated by Fairwinds Insights. We are seeking early adopters to try the feature so we can shape it in a way that works for multiple teams and user types.</p> <h3 id="visually-review-configuration-differences-between-workloads-in-different-clusters"><a href="#visually-review-configuration-differences-between-workloads-in-different-clusters" class="header-anchor">#</a> Visually review configuration differences between workloads in different clusters</h3> <p>For organizations who manage many clusters, keeping them aligned to a common, consistent standard can be time consuming. This is especially true when infrastructure is managed by different teams. We have developed a way to visualize the differences between two clusters so DevOps engineers can troubleshoot infrastructure issues and identify inconsistencies that need to be prioritized for resolution.</p> <h3 id="monitor-add-on-versions-requires-helm-3"><a href="#monitor-add-on-versions-requires-helm-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Monitor Add-on versions (requires Helm 3)</h3> <p>Keeping track of the add-ons installed in your cluster, the version you’re using, and whether there are any new updates available, can be manual and time-consuming. We’ve automated this effort by monitoring add-ons and their versions so you can stay on top of changes in the Kubernetes community. This feature requires Helm 3.</p> <h3 id="more-efficient-image-scanning"><a href="#more-efficient-image-scanning" class="header-anchor">#</a> More efficient image scanning</h3> <p>Trivy now runs more efficiently. Instead of scanning all images each time it runs, it will only scan 20 images at a time, with a preference for new images. This helps reduce overall compute overhead required for image scanning.</p> <h3 id="self-hosted"><a href="#self-hosted" class="header-anchor">#</a> Self-hosted</h3> <p>We have also started assessing demand for a self-hosted version of Fairwinds Insights. If you are interested in this capability, please reply to this email or contact us at <a href="mailto:insights@fairwinds.com">insights@fairwinds.com</a>.</p> <h2 id="_0-6-0"><a href="#_0-6-0" class="header-anchor">#</a> 0.6.0</h2> <h4 id="cost-metrics-improvements"><a href="#cost-metrics-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cost metrics improvements</h4> <p>We've made some improvements to the way we report cost.
