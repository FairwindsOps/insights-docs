# Nova
Nova is a project from Fairwinds for checking your
installed Helm charts against the latest versions available.
If there's a new release available, Nova will create an
Action Item for the upgrade.

## Remediation
All Action Items generated by Nova can be remediated by installing the latest
available version.

## Sample Report
Nova reports contain a list of Helm releases in the cluster, as well as the installed version.
```json
{
    "helm_releases": [
        {
            "namespace": "nginx-ingress",
            "newest": "",
            "outdated": false,
            "release": "nginx-ingress",
            "version": "0.2.0"
        }
    ]
}
```
