# OPA
Fairwinds Insights supports the use of custom OPA policies to create Action Items.

## Enable the OPA agent
To enable OPA, make sure you pass `--set opa.enabled=true` when
[installing the insights-agent](/installation/agent/setup)

See the [OPA Policy documentation](/configure/policy/policy) for more info on how
to write OPA checks and upload them to Insights.

## Sample Report 
OPA reports contain a list of Action Items generated by your OPA policies
```json
{
    "ActionItems": [
        {
            "Category": "Reliability",
            "Description": "String: No horizontal pod autoscaler found",
            "Remediation": "Create an HPA",
            "ResourceKind": "Deployment",
            "ResourceName": "local-path-provisioner",
            "ResourceNamespace": "local-path-storage",
            "Severity": 0,
            "EventType": "hpa-required",
            "Title": "HPA is required"
        }
    ]
}
```
