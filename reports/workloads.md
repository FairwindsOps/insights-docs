# Workloads
The Workloads report uploads a list of all the workloads running in your cluster,
including `Deployments`, `Jobs`, `CronJobs`, `ReplicaSets`, `DaemonSets`, and `Pods`.
This information is used to generate the information in the [workloads page](../features/workloads)

The Workloads report does not generate any Action Items.
